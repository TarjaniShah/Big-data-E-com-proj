A large number of these requests come from customers and local organizations and are received by ABC sales personnel and other employees. Currently, ABC has a program for global donations through an independent foundation outside of the U.S. and a North American donations program through a broad market program, but did not have a program to address compliant charitable giving regionally, especially in the areas where employees work and live. Risks were identified and it was determined to mitigate these risks, a localized program was necessary. This particular project created value by minimizing non-compliant and illegal activities by putting a compliant process and program in place that mitigates risks and takes the decision making out of the hands of the sales force and executives, thus maximizing effectiveness, and sets clear expectations for requestors. The project proved to be effective and efficient for ABC.</em></p><p></p><p><em>__________</em></p><p></p><p><em>An IT Company located in Hawaii was in need of a Code of Conduct. A code of conduct can produce value from both the perspective of decreasing net costs, as well as to help to generate net revenues. Decreasing net costs are mainly found in cost avoidance associated with risk mitigation. A code of conduct seeks to minimize employee misconduct which can result in lost productivity, external claims, litigation, and reputational damages to the firm. In terms of generating new revenues, a code of conduct offers an opportunity for a firm to positively differentiate themselves in the marketplace. While the mere existence of a code of conduct demonstrates certain commitments of the firm towards ethical conduct, ideally the code should translate into actual behaviors that are positive and in line with the company’s mission and values. Such an alignment, particularly for firms who are looking to outperform their competition, offers a way to create a competitive advantage for the firm that can directly impact the bottom line.</em></p><p><br/><em>__________</em></p><p></p><p><em>A large regional bank with several branch operations located in southern New England requested enhancements to its already existing business continuity and disaster recovery plan. A solid business continuity and disaster recovery plan is an essential part of a company’s information technology program. The project involved determining the main geographical and environmental risks and analyzing the severity of these risks present in the bank’s footprint. The same risks were then analyzed for other cities and states in the U.S. to determine possible locations and backup recovery centers.</em></p><p></p><p></p>',2,'Master of Science in Business Ethics and Compliance',1,NULL,'anywhere',NULL),(316,73,'published','Recruiting and Selecting a New Hire',NULL,'BU 408','Recruitment & Selection',28,2016,'summer','<p>Filling a position?

The electronic quadcopter market currently faces a problem of maximizing flight time. Low-end consumer models can fly for approximately 20 minutes on average. The objective of this project is to construct a quadcopter drone with an intelligent power management system to increase flight time. Using a commercially available drone kit as a base, we build a solar cell array and integrate it into the drone power system. Optimization for energy production versus mass is conducted to optimize production versus weight. Fourth-year knowledge required for this project includes power systems, hardware architecture, control systems, power conversion, energy loss, and embedded software design. The advantage of this drone, aside from longer flight time, is an improvement in the commercial feasibility of drones.</li></ul><p></p><ul><li>Cryptography : Cryptography in embedded devices, especially small or mobile, is often lacklustre because the cost, time, and power usage often outweigh the risks of having little to no security. The objective of this project (Cryptonite) is to enable low power, high quality, easy-to-use cryptography in embedded devices. This is done by providing a hardware implementation of the &quot;Networking and Cryptography Library&quot;, supporting low-power symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing. The hardware implementation is prototyped and proven on a field programmable gate array</li></ul><p>The second semester will be devoted to the execution of the project, as scoped out by the students in partnership with the industry partner.</p><p></p><p>The plan must reflect those normally produced by professional engineers in similar assignments.
